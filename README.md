## Summary

### What is a VPN?
A Virtual Private Network encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a secure server, masking your IP and protecting your privacy.

### How does it protect privacy?
It hides your real IP address and encrypts data, making it hard for ISPs, attackers, or websites to track your activities.

### VPN vs Proxy:
- **VPN:** Encrypts all traffic (system-wide).
- **Proxy:** Only works per application (e.g., browser), no encryption.

### VPN Protocols:
- OpenVPN
- WireGuard
- IKEv2/IPSec

### Limitations of VPN:
- May reduce internet speed
- Cannot prevent phishing or malware
- Doesn’t make you completely anonymous

### Benefits:
- Secure encrypted connection
- Bypass censorship or geo-blocks
- IP and location masking
